About
-----

CSS Regions bring new properties to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that provide:
    * text containers with custom shapes.
    * exclusion shapes which text will wrap around.
    * text that flows from one area into another.
We have put together a set of demos for you. They showcase some of the concepts we proposed to the W3C 
with CSS Regions: content threads, content shapes and text exclusions.
The samples presented here require a mini-browser using a specially modified version of WebKit. 
This experimental version will allow you to experiment with the samples, and are a way for us to explore 
the implementation options for these features. Please see the "Usage instructions" section below for 
instructions on how to run this browser.
You'll find basic samples that demonstrate individual CSS properties, as well as more complex ideas 
that highlight how they work together.
